    "# Prototyping an Autonomous Agent: From Concept to Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first in a series of prototypes exploring the architecture of an autonomous agent, as described in the `README.md`. The objective is to build a system capable of operating continuously, making decisions, and executing actions in a perpetual cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The OODA Architecture and the Page Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of our agent is the **OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)** loop. This prototype simulates this cycle using a \"gamebook\" (RPG book) model, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Pages** are states that contain a narrative and options.\n",
    "-   **Choices** are the transitions between states.\n",
    "-   The **Agent** navigates through these pages, simulating an LLM's decision-making process to achieve a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial implementation, the agent's \"world\" is a Python dictionary (`PAGES`), and the LLM's decision logic is simulated with simple rules. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept of an agent operating in a continuous feedback loop, paving the way for more complex future implementations that will include RAG, context monitoring, and self-improvement."

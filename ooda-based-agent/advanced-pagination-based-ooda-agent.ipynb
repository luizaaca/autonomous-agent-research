    "\n",
    "Este notebook implementa um agente autônomo projetado para navegar em uma narrativa de RPG estruturada como um livro-jogo. A estrutura do livro-jogo funciona como um **grafo direcionado**, onde cada página é um **nó** e as escolhas são as **arestas** que conectam os nós.\n",
    "\n",
    "O objetivo principal é testar e validar a capacidade do agente de:\n",
    "1.  **Observar** o estado atual (o texto da página).\n",
    "2.  **Orientar-se** com base em suas instruções e na sua \"ficha de personagem\" (seu estado interno).\n",
    "3.  **Decidir** qual a melhor ação (escolha) a tomar.\n",
    "4.  **Agir** para transitar para o próximo estado (a próxima página).\n",
    "\n",
    "Este ciclo é a implementação prática do modelo arquitetural **OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**, um framework conceitual para tomada de decisão em cenários dinâmicos. Cada bloco de código abaixo representa um componente fundamental desta arquitetura."

You find what you're looking for in the low hundreds and, by some miracle, there is a parking space opposite, just wide enough for your car. Safely wedged into the parking space, you take a moment to review the report. Verbal disagreements in the basement flat, three nights in a row. Two voices heard, getting louder each time. Culminating on the third night in an almighty crash that prompted a 999 (emergency services) call from the couple upstairs, the Romanian students next door, and a cyclist delivering curry who was startled enough to drop his bag over the railing, ending up with an unholy amalgam of tikka masala, korma, and saag aloo. The responding officers found signs of a struggle, but no other persons on the premises.

The Camden response team passed the details onto the local neighbourhood safety team, which is headed by a Sergeant Sutherland. You put a call into the local station and get her on the phone. Once you get past the initial wariness that most police have for agents of the Folly, she relaxes and opens up. \"I talked to the neighbours, confirmed their stories, made a follow-up visit to Mrs Fellaman, and found precisely nothing. And, since all I had on that night was leftover pasta bake, I parked my own car outside and waited until I heard the argument for myself.\" The sergeant's notes specify hearing two voices. But when Sutherland talked herself inside the flat, Mrs Fellaman was alone. \"That's right,\" she says. \"And I'll tell you, something was off about that flat.\" Members of the general public are regularly unsettled by inconsequential tosh. But Sergeant Sutherland's 30 years of experience in policing are as good a barometer for supernatural activity as you are likely to find. \"Your kind of weird bollocks,\" she says. Before you can take any further action on this case, such as an unauthorised entry to Mrs Fellaman's flat, you need to be sure that there is indeed some \"weird bollocks\" going on.\n",

On the edge of Somers Town you see a local butcher and pop out of the car for a necessary purchase. The Folly occupies a Georgian terrace on the south side of Russell Square, a location it shares with the Council of British International Schools, the London Mathematical Society, and a birdshit-covered statue of the fifth Duke of Bedford. You pull into the garage around the back. DC Grant's Ford Focus ST, or \"Asbo,\" is not there a bad sign. But perhaps his dog Toby is still in residence. Inside the Folly, Toby's basket is empty. A familiar ink-skirted figure glides past, her gaze moving across you like a duster on a long-neglected shelf. This is the housekeeper, Molly. You work up some courage and ask her if you can borrow the Folly's famed ghost-hunting dog. She stops and tilts her head to the side, the black almond-shaped eyes beneath her mob cap skewering you where you stand. After an awkward silence, you repeat the request, holding up your sausages. For a moment the meaty packet sits in your hand like a terrible, inadvertent insult. Then Molly straightens her head and glides to the door. She points to the far corner of the yard in a manner reminiscent of Donald Sutherland at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n",

      "Mrs Fellaman is still holding a cricket bat spattered with fresh blood. She clicks her tongue and runs the bat's wooden surface under the cold tap. While she is distracted, you turn your attention back to her domestic ghost. Something bothers you about the wall where he appeared. You've been in flats built to the same plan, and they had a pantry alcove to the left of the bricked-up fireplace. \"What about my husband?\" Mrs Fellaman asks. Still eyeing the wall, you explain that you were briefed about her family history, and her husband left her 30 years ago. He is currently living in Prestatyn, Wales, with a woman named Blodwyn. \"I knew that.\" She dries the cricket bat with a dishtowel. \"I just assumed he'd died recently, got over the Welsh bint, and come back where he belongs.\" You report that, as of this morning, he was alive and well. \"Pity,\" she says.\n",

      "\"So, who have I been talking to?\" Mrs Fellaman asks. As you advise her the ghost probably took the form of her husband to suit her, you knock on the wall in front of the missing alcove. Your third knock produces a hollow thud. You cast your eyes around the room and spot Knuckles' discarded masonry hammer. You get a solid two-handed grip and inform Mrs Fellaman that you are about to make a mess. \"Wait a minute,\" she says. You swing the hammer. The iron head goes through on the first blow. \"He did look like my Victor. How would he know?\" You knock out the loose plaster around the edges of the hole and use your phone as a torch to peer inside. There is a strong flash of carbolic soap and fish guts, the smell of sweat, and a blast of cold that numbs your fingers. Vestigia! The torch beam casts shadows around a hollow that you quickly recognise as the eye socket of a skull. Squinting, you see what might be a pile of other bones beneath it-the rest of the skeleton. \"What can you see?\" You look at Mrs Fellaman. Perhaps the body was some mistreated domestic worker from the late 19th century. Then again, Eugenia Fellaman has quite a temper. Perhaps there was somebody after her beloved Victor who never made it out of the flat. Nine times out of ten, when the bones are removed, the ghost goes with them. You can always borrow Ernie again and take a stroll along Prince of Wales Road, just to check. For now, though, you have a phone call to make. What happens afterwards will not be your problem. Well done, you've completed your first case file. Welcome to Rivers of London: the Roleplaying Game! THE END.\n",
